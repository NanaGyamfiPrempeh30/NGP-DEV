AWS Boto3 Automation with Terraform
This project provides a Terraform configuration to provision AWS resources (IAM roles and S3 buckets) and a Python script using Boto3 to interact with the provisioned S3 bucket. The automation sets up an S3 bucket with an associated IAM role and policy, and the Python script demonstrates basic S3 operations.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Boto3-terraform.git
cd Boto3


Configure AWS Credentials:Ensure AWS credentials are set up in ~/.aws/credentials or via environment variables:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"


Install Dependencies:

Install Terraform: Follow Terraform's official installation guide.
Install Python dependencies:pip install boto3




Initialize Terraform:
terraform init


Apply Terraform Configuration:
terraform plan
terraform apply

Confirm the apply action by typing yes when prompted.


Usage

Terraform Resources:

The main.tf file creates an S3 bucket.
The iam.tf file creates an IAM role with an attached policy defined in S3_policy.json.
The provider.tf file configures the AWS provider.


Running the Python Script:

Update main.py with the S3 bucket name output by Terraform (check terraform output).
Execute the script to perform S3 operations (e.g., upload, list, download files):python main.py




Example Terraform Output:After running terraform apply, retrieve the bucket name:
