http://example.com
Here's a site that I often visit: http://mywebsite.org
Another interesting website is http://interesting-site.net
http://old-protocol.com still uses the old http instead of https.
Some websites like http://unsecure.example should consider updating to https.
I found this cool resource at http://resourcehub.example/resource1
If you need documentation, check http://docs.example.com
